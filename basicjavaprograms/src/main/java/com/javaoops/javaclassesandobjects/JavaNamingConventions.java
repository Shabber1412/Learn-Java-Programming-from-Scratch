 * Java Naming Conventions
 * Java naming conventions are rules to follow when deciding what to name your identifiers, such as class, package, variable, constant, method, etc.
 * Following these conventions makes your code more readable and understandable for other developers.
 * Here are some common Java naming conventions:
 * 
 * 1. Class Names: Class names should be nouns and start with an uppercase letter. If the class name consists of multiple words, use camel case (e.g., MyClass, EmployeeDetails).
 * 2. Package Names: Package names should be in all lowercase letters and typically follow the reverse domain name convention (e.g., com.example.project).
 * 3. Variable Names: Variable names should start with a lowercase letter and use camel case for multiple words (e.g., myVariable, employeeName).
 * 4. Constant Names: Constant names should be in all uppercase letters with words separated by underscores (e.g., MAX_VALUE, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT).
 * 5. Method Names: Method names should start with a lowercase letter and use camel case for multiple words (e.g., calculateTotal, getEmployeeName).
 * 6. Interface Names: Interface names should be nouns or adjectives and start with an uppercase letter (e.g., Runnable, Comparable).
 * 7. Enum Names: Enum names should be in all uppercase letters with words separated by underscores (e.g., DAYS_OF_WEEK, COLORS).   
 * 8. Type Parameter Names: Type parameter names should be a single uppercase letter (e.g., T for type, E for element).
 * By following these naming conventions, you can create code that is easier to read and maintain.
 * For more detailed information, you can refer to the official Java documentation on naming conventions: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html
